KMeans Clustering with MakeBlobs Dataset
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the KMeans clustering algorithm using a synthetic dataset generated with make_blobs from scikit-learn.
Overview
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together. In this project, we:
- Generate data using make_blobs
- Apply KMeans clustering
- Visualize the results using matplotlib

Dataset
We use a synthetic dataset with predefined cluster centers and standard deviation using make_blobs. This helps us clearly see how well KMeans performs.
Features
- Simple implementation of KMeans
- Adjustable number of clusters
- Clear 2D visualization of clustered data

Installation & Usage
git clone https://github.com/OsamaAt/KMeans.git
cd KMeans


- Install dependencies:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
- Run the code: If you're using a .ipynb notebook, open it in Jupyter and run cell by cell. If it's a .py script, you can run:

python kmeans.py
Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Example Output
Clusters will be visualized in a 2D scatter plot, with each color representing a different cluster.

Future Ideas
Add support for more datasets
Use Elbow Method or Silhouette Score
Compare KMeans with DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering
